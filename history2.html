            <strong>Overview:</strong> The internet as we know it today is a
            vast, interconnected network that has transformed how we
            communicate, work, learn, and interact. But it wasn't always this
            way. It has been around for longer than you might think.

          <h2>Origins and Standards</h2>
          <p>
            The history of the Internet begins in 1969 with
            <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, a
            network created by the U.S. Department of Defense to maintain
            communications during the Cold War. The first message between
            computers (from UCLA to Stanford) only managed to transmit “LO”
            before crashing—yet it marked the start of a revolution. The first
            email was sent way back in 1971, and computers first started to
            digitally share information in 1983. The true turning point came in
            1989, when Tim Berners-Lee invented
            <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web"
              >the World Wide Web at CERN</a
            >
            in Switzerland. This was instrumental in making the Internet a
            useful tool for the public. Not only did it create the space for web
            browsers and websites to exist, but it paved the way for people to
            access visual media online. In 1991, The World Wide Web was publicly
            released, enabling people to share and access documents and websites
            through a standardized system.

          <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
          <p>
            Websites were being created at a blistering pace to help anyone with
            an internet connection to learn, shop and socialise online. Some of
            the world's biggest websites, such as Amazon, Google, eBay, IMDb and
            Yahoo, first went online in the '90s. Then followed the launch of
            Wikipedia, Facebook and Youtube. In 2008, Google launched Chrome
            with a focus on speed, security, and automatic updates. Today,
            browsers iterate rapidly and converge on standards through the W3C
            and related bodies, with accessibility, privacy, and performance now
            core priorities.
